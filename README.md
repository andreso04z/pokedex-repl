# ts-pokedex

A command-line Pokédex built in TypeScript. This REPL-based application allows users to explore Pokémon data directly from the terminal.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

This project is part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) TypeScript backend roadmap. Key learning points include:

- Building a robust REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) system in TypeScript
- Implementing command pattern for extensible CLI applications
- Writing clean, type-safe code with TypeScript
- Managing application state and command registry
- Unit testing TypeScript applications

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ts-pokedex
