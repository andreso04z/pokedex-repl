## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Learning

This project is part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) TypeScript backend roadmap. Through this project, I'm learning:

- How to work with JSON data
- Making HTTP requests in Node.js
- Implementing caching to reduce API calls
- Building a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) app in the terminal
