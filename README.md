- Building a robust REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) system in TypeScript
- Implementing command pattern for extensible CLI applications
- Writing clean, type-safe code with TypeScript
- Managing application state and command registry
- Unit testing TypeScript applications
- Implementing a versatile caching system to reduce calls to external API's
